        <h3><center/>5 Ways To Spice Up Your Love Life</h3>
        <p> 
          Do you ever get bored of the same routine? Is the spark gone in your relationship?
          These 5 tips will help you launch your relationship into a whole new level!
        </p>
        <br/>
          <h4>1) Do not stop taking care of yourself!</h4>
          Sometimes when we get comfortable with our partner, we stop taking care of ourselves. But, DO NOT STOP caring! Go to the gym, get your nails done, and make sure you eat healthy! The more you look after yourselves, the more you will want to share that with your partner, and that creates a spark in your relationship!
          <h4>2) Share a 20 Second Hug</h4>
          When you hug for at least 20 seconds, it increases levels of [the hormone] oxytocin in both men and women and makes you feel closer          
          <h4>3) Send a Love Note!</h4>
          Handwritten love letters may be a thing of the past, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t express your love via written communication. Sometimes it’s easier than saying it aloud.
          <h4>4) Engage in physical contact outside the bedroom.</h4>
          Even snuggling in front of the TV or holding hands while walking down the street can help bring back the spark to your relationship.          
          <h4>5) Plan little date nights!</h4>
          If you haven’t done so for a while, consider planning a surprise romantic date with your mate to enrich your relationship. When was the last time you went the extra mile for your loved one? It is easy to get comfortable in a relationship and forget to treat them in a special way, so be sure that your mate will be be feel surprised, happy, and loved when you go to extra trouble to plan something they will enjoy.

        <h3>5 signs He Loves You </h3>
        <p> 
          I’m convinced that one of the most significant questions a woman asks is, “Does he really love me?” This question starts when she is a little girl learning what love is supposed to look like from the way her Dad interacts with her. Whether she has a great dad, a terrible dad or an absent one, there will be defining moments when she asks herself, “Does he really love me?”
          Men and women tend to express their love in unique ways. Many items on this are equally present in how most women display love. These generalizations don’t apply to every man or every relationship, but I’m firmly convinced that if a man truly loves you, he will consistently do the following things (in no particular order)…
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>1) He will make TIME with you a priority</h4>
        Time is the “currency” of relationships, and if he truly loves you, he will invest into his relationship with you by making timing together a priority.         
        
        <h4>2) He will desire to PROTECT you (physically, emotionally, verbally, spiritually and financially).</h4>
        Men are hard-wired to be protectors. We have an instinctive, God-given desire to protect the ones we love. This protection will manifest itself in much more than just physical protection. If a man truly loves you, he will want to protect your reputation.        
        
        <h4>3) He’ll intentionally work to bring out the BEST in you instead of always pointing out the WORST in you.</h4>
        If he really loves you, even when he disagrees with you or wants to help you improve in a certain area, he will communicate with respect, thoughtfulness and patience. He’ll strive to be your biggest encourager; not your biggest critic. He’ll want to be the one who wipes away your tears; not the one who causes them.      
        
        <h4>4) He will consistently communicate his COMMITMENT to you.</h4>
        Love, first and foremost, is a commitment (not just a feeling). He should communicate how he “feels” about you in a positive and adoring way, but even more often than that, he should reaffirm his commitment to you.

        <h4>5) He will SAY IT with his words, DISPLAY IT with his actions, and PROVE IT with his consistency.</h4>
        It really all comes down to this. If he really love you, he will show it through CONSISTENCY in both his words and his actions. Love is a commitment and commitment is displayed through consistency. If he’s not doing everything on this list, talk about it with him.

        <h3>5 signs He Does Not Love You </h3>
        <p> 
        There's no shame in wanting love — especially when you're convinced you already have it. Some of us spend an awful lot of time dedicating ourselves to the pursuit of romance, that when even the slightest shred of it shows up somewhere, we hope for the best.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>1) He never opens up emotionally</h4>
        If you imagine that he’s not opening up, then that’s probably the case. When you’re not interested in someone, you don’t usually bother expressing yourself, mainly because you haven’t emotionally invested yourself in them. He’s not interested in your opinion.        
        
        <h4>2)He only seems close when he wants sex </h4>
        There are those moments when you really think that he’s the one. But the more you think about it, you realize that he’s only like that right before the two of you have sex. He has goals in this relationship, and they all seem to revolve around getting laid.        
        
        <h4>3) He’s a total opponent of PDA</h4>
        If he’s not willing to show affection in public, then there is something wrong. Sure, making out in front of people is a little weird, but he can’t even handle holding hands or pecks on the lips, it may beg you to wonder why he’s like that.        
        
        <h4>4) You sometimes feel like a stranger around him</h4>
        There’s nothing worse than being in a relationship where you feel a knot in the pit of your stomach. Something is off. You can’t quite put your finger on it, but when the two of you are together, you seem like strangers. This happens occasionally, and it’s not telling of something positive, that’s for sure.
        
        <h4>5) He never seems invested in the moment. </h4>
        When people don’t care about what they’re doing with someone, they most likely don’t care about that particular someone. This is the case with you. He doesn’t seem invested because his mind is on other things; things that have his attention far more than you do.        </div>
