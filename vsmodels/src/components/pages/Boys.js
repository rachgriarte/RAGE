        <h3><center/>5 Ways To Spice Up Your Love Life</h3>
        <h5> Do you ever get bored of the same routine? Is the spark gone in your relationship?
         These 5 tips will help you launch your relationship into a whole new level!
        </h5>
        <br/>
          <h4>1) Do not stop taking care of yourself!</h4>
          Sometimes when we get comfortable with our partner, we stop taking care of ourselves. But, DO NOT STOP caring! Go to the gym, get your nails done, and make sure you eat healthy! The more you look after yourselves, the more you will want to share that with your partner, and that creates a spark in your relationship!
          <h4>2) Share a 20 Second Hug</h4>
          When you hug for at least 20 seconds, it increases levels of [the hormone] oxytocin in both men and women and makes you feel closer          
          <h4>3) Send a Love Note!</h4>
          Handwritten love letters may be a thing of the past, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t express your love via written communication. Sometimes it’s easier than saying it aloud.
          <h4>4) Engage in physical contact outside the bedroom.</h4>
          Even snuggling in front of the TV or holding hands while walking down the street can help bring back the spark to your relationship.          
          <h4>5) Plan little date nights!</h4>
          If you haven’t done so for a while, consider planning a surprise romantic date with your mate to enrich your relationship. When was the last time you went the extra mile for your loved one? It is easy to get comfortable in a relationship and forget to treat them in a special way, so be sure that your mate will be be feel surprised, happy, and loved when you go to extra trouble to plan something they will enjoy.      </div>
